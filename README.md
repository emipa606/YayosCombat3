Update of YAYOs mod
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2038409475
Based on the abandoned 1.3 update by Ogliss
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2513695736

## Changes from 1.5

The advanced animations have been removed from the mod, if you want these animations you can add [https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2877292196](Yayo's Animation) as it already does the same animations.

- Fixed the missing config-text
- Added in the various fixes XT-0xFF and PrincessOfEvil in the [https://github.com/Ogliss/Yayos-Combat-3/tree/Dev-1.3](dev-branch) of the original git-repository
- If [https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2944488802](Melee Animation) is loaded the advanced animations is only used for ranged weapons
- A big thanks to Ferris that made most of the work for the 1.5 update, without them this would have taken a lot longer!
- Also check out the [https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2796514196](Yayo's Combat 3 - Addon) by Syrus, it contains expanded ammo handling and some compatibility fixes for other mods.

# *** Completely changes the combat system**


# *** Powerful armor algorithm**

Penetration becomes very important.
High-tech armor is no longer pierced by Low-tech weapon

# *** Ammunition system and Loadout**

All ranged weapons are changed to consume ammunition.
When the enemy runs out of ammo, they will melee combat with a gun.

Ammunition is divided according to techlevel and damage type.
For example, flamethrowers require industrial explosive ammunition.

You can set the loadout of ammo and medicine in the drug policy.

# *** Detail**


- There is no need to use it with other yayo combat versions. The new version always includes the features of the previous version.

- The accuracy algorithm is more closely related to the shooting skill level and eliminates the stupid situation of shooting rabbits all day long.

- The armor algorithm compares the tech level of the weapon and the armor and applies the penetrating power differently.

- If the armor is better, it deflect almost all attacks.

- If the penetration of a weapon is high, the durability of the armor is sharply reduced.

- When the armor's durability drops above a certain number, the bullet starts to hit.

- The percentage of durability at which the bullet starts to hit is determined by comparing penetration and defense.

- Reduce enemy armor's durability first with weapons with high tech levels and high penetration. And put the bullets at the weakened ones


# *** Load Order**


- core
- hugslib
- gunplay
- dual wield
- [ this mod ] 



# *** Compatibility**


- This mod has amazing compatibility.
Weapons and armor added by most mods will automatically apply this mod's effect.

- If a feature crash with another mod, you can fix it by turning it off in the options.



# *** Incompatible mods**

# *** Recommended mod ( Not Required )**
